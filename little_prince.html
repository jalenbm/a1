<p>
As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in<br> my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class="underline">I felt deeply <br>moved, and stirred.</span>
<span>It seemed to me that I was<br> carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
<span class="orange">It seemed to me, even,<br>
that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>In the <br>
moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed<br>
eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I<br>
said to myself:<span class="red">"What I see here is nothing but a<br>
shell. What is most important is invisible…"<br>
</span>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a<br>
half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="red">"What moves me<br>
so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping<br>
here,is his loyalty to a flower—-the image of a rose<br>
that shines through his whole being like the flame<br>
of a lamp, even when he is asleep…"</span> <span class="underline">And I felt<br>
him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of<br>
protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that<br>
might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…</span>
